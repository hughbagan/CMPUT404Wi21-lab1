Lab 1

Question 1:
https://github.com/hughbagan/CMPUT404Wi21-lab1

Question 2:
`requests` system version: 2.23.0

Question 3:
`requests` venv version: 2.25.1

Question 4:
The virtual environment python is isolated from the system (my computer). Since I am running Ubuntu, my system will have a stable version. The virtual environment can afford to be more recent since it is supposed to be agnostic.

Question 5:
http://google.com returns 301 "Moved Permanently"
http://www.google.com returns 200

Question 6:
http://google.com/teapot returns 301 "Moved Permanently"
`curl -iL` will follow it to where it was moved to and request that, too, in which case it returns 418 "I'm a Teapot" (ie. http://www.google.com/teapot)

Question 7:
It appears to have added a field to the form...
    <DT>X: <i>&lt;type 'instance'&gt;</i>
    <DD>MiniFieldStorage('X', 'Y')
The curl manpage tells me that `-X` is used to specify a custom request method. Therefore it is useful for POST-ing payloads specified by the `-d` flag to the webpage .
